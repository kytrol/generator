## Grid Format
If more time was given for this assessment, I probably would have spent time allowing for the grid format to have non equal dimensions. It isn't in the specifications for the project, but I think this program would function alright with a nonstandard format. Though I did not spend time testing it with any grids without equal dimensions.

## Testing
There are very basic tests for some of the functions used in the program. With more time, the test suites would be way more flushed out. The code coverage for the tests is minimal at the moment.

## Mutation Rules
I might refactor the mutation rules if I had more time. I like having them indexed as an object, but this makes it a bit less readable. And jsdoc comments for functions in an object might look pretty messy.

## Max Generation
Right now the max generation is hardcoded as a constant. Might be interesting to accept user input as to what generation they would like to find. As well as possibly adding input for a user defined grid.
